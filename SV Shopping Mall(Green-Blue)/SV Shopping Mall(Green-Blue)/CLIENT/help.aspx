                            VISA and MasterCard payments are processed through an online payment gateway system.
                            You need not worry about your credit card information falling into the wrong hands
                            because your bank will authorize the credit card transaction directly without any
                            information passing through us. In approximately 25-30 seconds (depending on your
                            internet connection) your bank will issue via the online payment gateway an authorization
                            code and confirmation of completion of transactions.

                                a credit card at a restaurant because we do not retain your credit card information.
                                You can be assured that <strong>SV Shopping</strong> offers you the highest standards
                                of security currently available on the Net so as to ensure that your shopping experience
